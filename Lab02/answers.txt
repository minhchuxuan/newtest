Question:
If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:Â 
Java does not allow this. Since both title and category are of type String, Java would not be able to distinguish between the constructor DigitalVideoDisc(String category) and DigitalVideoDisc(String title).
